# Key Considerations for designing data visualizations

::: incremental
1.  **Who**: Intended Audience
2.  **When**: Stage in the Research Process
3.  **How**: Visual Variables
4.  **What**: Plot Type
5.  **Why**: Goal, Intended Outcome

# WHEN: Visualization & the Research Lifecycle

Do you intend to:

1.  communicate what you already know? **(confirmatory data analysis –\> explanatory visualization)**
2.  explore what you do not yet know? **(exploratory data anaysis –\> exploratory visualization)**

## WHEN: Visualization & the Research Lifecycle, 2

1.  explanatory visualization
    1.  *is often* close-ended; proposes one answer
    2.  come at the end of the research process
2.  exploratory visualization
    1.  *should always be* open-ended
    2.  *is sometimes* interactive
    3.  comes early in the research process

## WHEN: Visualization & the Research Lifecycle, 3

The logic of exploratory data analysis and visualization:

-   deduction

-   induction

-   **abduction**

# Logic and Data Visualization

## **Deduction**

-   evaluate hypotheses

-   "prove that something must be" (Charles Sanders Peirce)

-   draw logical conclusions from premises

-   limitations: often can't prove all premises are true

## Deduction, Example

Premise 1: All As are Bs (True)

Premise 2: C is A (True)

Premise 3: C is B (True)

## **Induction**

-   justifies the hypothesis

-   "shows that something actually is operative" (Peirce)

-   concludes a general law or premise based on numerous cases

-   limitations: unseen cases could disprove hypothesis

## Induction, Example

A1, A2, A3 ... A100 = B

A1, A2, A3 ... A100 = C

Therefore, B is C

## **Abduction**

-   generates new ideas or hypotheses

-   "suggests that something may be"

-   look for a pattern in a surprising phenomenon and suggest a plausible hypothesis

-   value: Peirce: abduction is the only logical operation that can generate new ideas (and new questions?)

## Abduction, Example

The surprising phenomenon, X, is observed

Among hypotheses A, B, and C, A is capable of explaining X

Hence, there is a reason to pursue A.
