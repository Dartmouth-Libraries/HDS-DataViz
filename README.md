# Data Visualization
## Health Data Sciences 722

## 1. Overview

This course offers an introduction to the dynamic and exciting field of data visualization. By visualizing data in thoughtful, engaging, and colorful ways we can uncover hidden patterns, make nuanced arguments, and tell stories about data. You will learn how to read, design, and create visualizations for various types of data (numerical, categorical, textual, spatial etc.) through hands-on practice. In particular, you will learn how to create both static and interactive visualizations using the programming language R and the plotting libraries **ggplot**, **plotly**, and **shiny**. We encourage collaboration and the exchange of ideas with classmates and embrace a cautious, critical, transparent, and experimental use of AI.
