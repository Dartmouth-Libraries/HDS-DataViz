# Creating a Shiny App with an AI Assistant

## **1. Project Overview & Learning Objectives**

### **Objective**

To design, build, and deploy a simple, interactive data visualization dashboard using R Shiny. This project will synthesize your skills in data exploration, visualization design (ggplot2/plotly), storytelling, and basic web application development. You will create a dashboard that allows a user to explore a health-related dataset and gain insights into a specific question or topic.

### **A Key Component: The AI Copilot**

You are not only permitted but **encouraged** to use Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or Claude to assist you in writing and debugging your Shiny code. A critical part of this assignment will be documenting and reflecting on how you used AI as a tool to accelerate your development and learning process.

### Guiding Framework

1.  AUTOMATE THE TEDIOUS: Let AI, more specifically LLMs, help you code and do much of the tedious work for you.
2.  FOCUS ON THE BIG IDEAS AND CONCEPTS:
3.  USE AI AS AN ASSISTANT NOT REPLACEMENT
4.  MULTI-SHOT PROMPTING - ENGAGE IN CONVERSATION
5.  USE AI AS A LEARNING ASSISTANT
